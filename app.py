    Revenue is in our case - the company value - a share is a dividend of this value
        - i.e Apple is worth in our case - 5m - it is going to have 10,000 shares - so each is 5m/10,000 - Â£500.00 each
    The computation will determine probability - which will determine if the revenue increases/decrease or stays the same
    The share price will then be updated by dividing revenue by the quantity of shares allocated
    The market is based upon risk - high risk transactions can go bad but PAY OFF VERY WELL
"""

    The computation variable will be calculated by: 
        - Going though every company in the market list:
            - Check the market
            - Check the age
            - Check the number of employees
            - Check if the company has some sort of advantage over its competitors

            - It is very likely that it will stay the same / have various small changes (8/10).
 
        # This would be a very high risk but potentially very rewarding transaction

            - Standard probability of failure is 2/5
