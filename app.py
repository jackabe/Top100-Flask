# This module will return a dictionary linking each company id to each updated company share price

"""
    Revenue is in our case - the company value - a share is a dividend of this value
        - i.e Apple is worth in our case - 5m - it is going to have 10,000 shares - so each is 5m/10,000 - Â£500.00 each
    The computation will determine probability - which will determine if the revenue increases/decrease or stays the same
    The share price will then be updated by dividing revenue by the quantity of shares allocated
    The market is based upon risk - high risk transactions can go bad but PAY OFF VERY WELL
"""

"""
    The computation variable will be calculated by: 
        - Going though every company in the market list:
            - Check the market
            - Check the age
            - Check the number of employees
            - Check the size of revenue
            - Check standard deviation and average of previous prices
            - Check if the company has some sort of advantage over its competitors
"""

""" 
    Now we need to create probability events off of this variable which will increase/reduce revenue
        # This would be a safe transaction
        If the computation is more than 70: 
            - Standard probability of failure is 1/10
            - Standard Probability of big success is 1/10
            - It is very likely that it will stay the same / have various small changes (8/10).
 
        # This would be a regular transaction
        If the computation is less than 30: 
            - Standard probability of failure is 2/5
            - Standard Probability of big success is 2/5
            - It is unlikely to stay the same (1/5).
            
        # This would be a very high risk but rewarding transaction
        If the computation is between 30 and 70
            - Standard probability of failure is 1/5
            - Standard Probability of big success is 1/5
            - Chances are, it will stay the same / have various small changes (3/5).
